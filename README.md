Heroku Buildpack - Tesseract
===========================
```
Tambahan bahasa indonesia
```
Added the libraries to use Tesseract 3.02 on Heroku
The buildpack supports several languages now.

This buildpack is built to be used through [heroku-buildpack-multi](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi).
In your app you need to:
```
heroku config:set
BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi
```

Then, create a `.buildpacks` file inside your app:
```
https://github.com/heroku/_YOUR_MAIN_BUILDPACK
https://github.com/fouady/heroku-buildpack-tesseract.git
```
See the documentation of heroku-build-multi for a detailed explanation
how to use it.
